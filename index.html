        <p> My hobby is coding applications, games and websites whenever I get time. 
          Whenever I have free time, I spend it in coding and also attending my coding classes.
          I am just 12 years old in 6th standard and I have started coding.
          Even my family and friends motivate me for it. Coding can change the whole future.
          Its very intersting to create apps and games by your own.
